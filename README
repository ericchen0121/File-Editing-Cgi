Notes: 
0. If you place all files in this repository into your "XAMPP/htdocs/File-Editing-Cgi" folder, then instructions will work like this

1. Run index.html from a browser. Run it over the web, not as a local file. (in your browser, go to http://127.0.0.1/File-Editing-Cgi/index.html

2. This should bring up an empty screen with place to enter a filename. Enter a filename of an existing editable file (editfile.txt has already been created and should work) in the "data" folder. 

3. The file's text contents should open. It will ask for a password. The current password is '1234' (its sha hash is hardcoded into save.cgi). 

4. Change any text you want to, and now press Save. 

5. The confirmation screen should appear, letting you know the file has now been edited. 

6. You're done! Thanks for using my super simple remote CGI File Editing service!
